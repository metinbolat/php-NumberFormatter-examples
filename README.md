# PHP NumberFormatter Examples

This repository contains examples of PHP's `NumberFormatter` class, created as part of my learning process. The examples demonstrate various formatting options and localization features available in the `NumberFormatter` class.

Feel free to explore the examples, modify them, or use them as a reference for your own learning process.

## About
This repo is not intended as a project or library â€” it's simply a collection of example scripts I wrote while experimenting with NumberFormatter.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- The `intl` extension must be enabled
